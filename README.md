# Object_detection_Using_yolo

Object detection is a phenomenon in computer vision that involves the detection of various objects in digital images or videos. Some of the objects detected include people, cars, chairs, stones, buildings, and animals.

## This phenomenon seeks to answer two basic questions:

What is the object? This question seeks to identify the object in a specific image.
Where is it? This question seeks to establish the exact location of the object within the image.


Object detection consists of various approaches such as fast R-CNN, Retina-Net, and Single-Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD). Although these approaches have solved the challenges of data limitation and modeling in object detection, they are not able to detect objects in a single algorithm run. YOLO algorithm has gained popularity because of its superior performance over the aforementioned object detection techniques.

YOLO is an abbreviation for the term ‘You Only Look Once’. This is an algorithm that detects and recognizes various objects in a picture (in real-time). Object detection in YOLO is done as a regression problem and provides the class probabilities of the detected images.
